---THIS TEXT FILE CONTAINS ALL FINDING TOOLS IN LINUX---

1) GREP - Global Regular Expression Print
	it is used to find a file, directory or a word
	It is case sensitive

	grep (what to find) (where to find)

	-i = case sensitive
	-r = recursively

2) FIND - similar to grep

	find (location if wanted) -name (what to find)

3) AWK - It prints with the colums and can bifergate accordin our needs

	awk (condition) (what to find) (which column to print) (where to find)


	EXAMPLE :- awk '$1>="2023-06-12" && NR>=1 && NR<=10' /ERROR/ {print NR $1,$4,$7} qpp.log


	conditions = It is the no. of how many rows you want . 'NR>= 1 && NR<=10' [NR = No. of Rows]
	column = it shows which coluum to print when you get the specific (what to find) and print it .
			{print NR $1,$3,$5} [$1 = 1st column ....]
	


4) SED - screen editor
	
	It replaces the word from a txt file and replaces it with what we want

	sed 's/test@123/querty@123/g' dev.env

	s= string
	test@123 = It is to be changed
	querty@123 = What it is replaced with 
	g = globally (everything is replacced)
		1 first word changed
		2 second word changed
		.
		.
